Part 2: The Solution & The Tech (The "How")

Malt: GabAI Sense Guard is an intelligent, proactive guardian insole for individuals with Diabetic Neuropathy for analysis and rehabilitation. We use three distinct neuropathy sensors powered by breakthrough, clinical AI research:
One, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to track gait geometry, how patients walk 
(show research)
Second, Thermal and Pressure Resistors to detect inflammation and "hotspots," how diabetic ulcers develop 
(show research)
(show research)
And third, Microvibration Actuators—our secret weapon for active nerve testing and rehabilitation.

Malt: Our multi-sensor AI Engine analyzes three data streams to predict the decline.

Part 3: The Demo (Live Simulation)

Stream One: Gait Asymmetry. 

(Ayen walks normally, then suddenly drags his right foot.)

We use motion sensors to model the user's walking pattern. The AI detects even subtle left-right deviations—like a slight drag of the foot. When consistent fatigue happens, the AI detects the deviation instantly, flagging the fall risk before the stumble, earlier than doctors can.

Nico: Stream Two: Heat and Pressure. 

(Ayen stops and leans heavily on the ball of his foot.)

When nerves fail, you can't feel inflammation. Our sensors just detected a friction spike and a temperature rise that doesn't match her baseline. That is a "Hotspot"—an invisible warning sign of a forming ulcer.

Malt: Stream Three: The Nerve Test 

(Ayen looks at the phone.)

The insole just sent a specific micro-vibration to his sole. He felt it and confirmed. We are actively tracking the Vibration Perception Threshold (VPT), a test for neuropathy progression, effectively logging the life of his nerves daily.

Nico: Finally: Correction. 

(Ayen resumes walking confidently.) 

Based on the said data, the insole generates a personalized rehabilitative vibration. Clinical research proves microvibrations can serve as a peripheral signal. It acts as a cue, replacing lost nerve feedback so she can walk safely. 

The data is also used to predict fall and ulcer risk and tracks neuropathy changes over time through VPT. Your data is shared to you and your caregivers.
